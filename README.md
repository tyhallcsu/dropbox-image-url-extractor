# Dropbox Image URL Extractor

This Tampermonkey script allows you to extract image URLs from a Dropbox folder page and copy them to your clipboard with a single click. The script adds a "Copy all URLs" button to the Dropbox page, and when you click the button, it scrolls through the entire folder, collects all image URLs, and copies them to your clipboard.
